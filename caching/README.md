  <img src="insert-image-url-here" align="right" width="50"></h1>


## Intro
This project consists of several tasks designed to build an intermediate understanding of caching in Python.

## Learning Objectives

1. **What is a caching system?**

2. **What is FIFO and LIFO?**

3. **What is LRU, MRU, and LFU?**

4. **What is the purpose of a caching system?**
   
5. **What limits do a caching system have?**

# Concepts

## Resources and Descriptions
[*How to use caching with built-in methods in Python*](https://kadermiyanyedi.medium.com/how-to-use-caching-in-python-5d7a150dd30c)

[*FIFO*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#First_In_First_Out_%28FIFO%29) and [*LIFO*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Last_In_First_Out_%28LIFO%29)

## What is caching? What is its purpose?
Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed or recently accessed data in a temporary storage space, known as a cache. The purpose of caching is to improve data retrieval performance by reducing the time it takes to access the data. 

Within these projects, I am using Python classes that inherit from the BaseCaching class given to me by my instructor. The methods I've created will store data, retrieve data, utilize eviction policies, explore efficiency improvement, and learn the limitations of caches.

## FIFO and LIFO

### FIFO: First-In-First-Out
FIFO is a data structure and an eviction policy used in caching systems where the oldest item is removed first.

### LIFO: Last-In-First-Out
LIFO, also known as the stack, is another data structure and eviction policy where the newest items are removed first.

## LRU, MRU, LFU

### LRU: Least Recently Used
LRU is an eviction policy where the least recently accessed items are removed first
