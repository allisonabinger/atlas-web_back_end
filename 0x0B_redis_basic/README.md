# Concepts:

[**UnitTest**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
Unit Testing Framework - supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework. 

[**Mock Object Library*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html)
Using `unittest.mock` to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects, and to make assertions about how they have been used. Additionally, `patch()` acts a function decorator, class decorator, or a context manager. Inside the body of the function or `with` statement, the target is patched with a new object.
