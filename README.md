# Welcome!
This repository hosts the all of the back-end concepts that I worked with while I was a student at Atlas School Tulsa. It contains various projects focused on back-end development, including implementations in multiple languages and covering various back-end concepts and techniques.

# Navigation and Key Concepts
While a majority of these projects use Python as the main language, you will find other languages and concepts outside of python used throughout the projects. There are also several projects that use JavaScript (ES6)!
